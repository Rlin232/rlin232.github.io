Hi, my name is Ryan Lin, an undergraduate student at the California Institute of Technology. I am currently pursuing a degree in 
Computer Science, with a keen focus on machine learning. 

My journey in academia has brought me to my role as an undergraduate researcher at the 
Anima AI + Science Lab. Equipped with the knowledge I gained from various graduate-level machine learning courses, I hope to delve deeper into the 
complex concepts and techniques related to artificial intelligence. 

In the industry, I have spent three summers as a full-stack developer and a DevSecOps engineer at the MITRE Corporation, where I honed my skills in 
software engineering and learned about industry practices and methodologies. I also worked with MITRE during the school year as a part-time employee. 

Beyond academics and professional pursuits, I am a part of the Caltech NCAA Division III Swimming & Diving team. Go Beavers!
